models:
  # Define schema specifications (descriptions, tests, etc.) for any
  # intermediate models you create here.
  #
  # Intermediate models help break down complex logic into smaller, reusable steps.
  # They are typically materialized as views or tables within dbt.
  #
  # Example:
  # - name: int_your_intermediate_model
  #   description: "Brief description of what this intermediate model does."
  #   columns:
  #     - name: column_a
  #       tests:
  #         - not_null
